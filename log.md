# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 10th, 2017
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Tribute Page by researching topic and writing copy, then placed HMTL tags around different sections of the copy.

**Thoughts:** It was much easier to start a project since detailed instructions were provided. Easier than thinking up random project ideas on my own.

### Day 2: June 11th, 2017
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Started adding bootstrap and figuring out how to format the Tribute page. Had to work a lot with the photos to get them centered on the page. Realized the link to CSS I was using wasn't working with the bootstrap I was adding.

**Thoughts**: I got frustrated a few times, but realized the setbacks were worth it when the page started to come together.

### Day 3: June 12th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I started the portfolio page today. I found unsplash and used a great photo for the background. I also got an inverse top navigation bar to work that spans the whole width of the page. 

**Thoughts** I had to look up a lot of CSS tricks but am starting to get better at it.

### Day 4: June 13th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the portfolio page today. I added the next section of the site including a bio and a photo. I like how the bio turned out, added a box background so the letters were easier to read. And used css to make the photo a circle. 

**Thoughts** I like how the site looks so far. It feels more natural to work on code now and I'm understanding how everything works together.

### Day 5: June 14th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the portfolio page again today. I added the next section of the site that had the portfolio page. I just added a title and worked on getting the background photo to center correctly.

**Thoughts** I have to do some research on portfolio pages and thumbnails.

### Day 6: June 15th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the portfolio page today. I researched how to add thumbnails. I added 9 and chose different photos of cacti to go along with the theme of the first photo. I also updated the Home page to look more clean & modern.

**Thoughts** I need actual work so the portfolio isn't just a bunch of placeholder photos.

### Day 6: June 16th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the portfolio page contact form. I looked up different styles of contact forms and decided on a very clean one. Had trouble getting the title to work and using an underlay to make text more readable.

**Thoughts** Css is annoying

### Day 7: June 17th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I realized that the entire page has a strip of space where the background photos don't span the width of the page. Tried a number of combinations of background-size: cover, and re-centering them. Decided to copy a bare bones version of the site into another pen and work on it there. I also added a link to a different CSS repository. Something I did in that second pen worked because the space went away.

**Thoughts** I have no clue what was causing that strip. So the main lesson today was: try it all to see what works.

### Day 8: June 18th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Put the finishing touches on my portfolio page. Turned it in. Realized my hamburger menu icon that appears when the screen shrinks doesn't actually open a dropdown menu. Spent the coding hour trying to fix it but no luck yet.

**Thoughts** what's a media query and where do i get one?!?!
